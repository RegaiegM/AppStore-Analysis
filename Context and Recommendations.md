# Apple-Store-Analysis
Data Analytics project using SQL and the Apple Store dataset
## Business Case: 
By analyzing the Apple store data, help the client decide on what kind of app to build.

## Recommendations
#### 1- Paid Apps generally achieve higher ratings than free ones. 
This could be due to a number of reasons. Users who pay for an app might have higher engagement or derive value from the app.
Therefore if the quality of the App is good, we can consider charging a certain amount for it.
#### 2- Apps supporting a number of languages between 10 and 30 had better rating. 
it can be concluded that the quantity of the language doesn't matter as much as the languages targeted.
#### 3- Certain app categories like finance and books have lower ratings
This suggests that within these genres the user's needs are not being met, therefore an opportuinity for an unsaturated market presents itself
#### 4- The length of the description of an app has a positive correlation with its rating.
Users likely appreciate having a detailed description of the apps functions and usability before downloading. expectation setting leads to increasiing user satisfaction.
#### 5-The average rating is 3.5.
Therefore to stand out from the crowd, our app needs to have a rating higher than 3.5
#### 6- apps in the gaming and entertaining genres have a very high volume of apps.
this suggests a market that is more saturated and competitive. but it also suggests more demand in this market.
